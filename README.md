This is small web application to display a grid of photos from flikr.  
 
When a photo is clicked, the photo displays in a larger size with its tags and title. 

It uses react and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) 
using the recommendations and tooling provided therein, note that this includes not using a css preprocessor.

There are no tests other than a basic test to prove the site renders (this is not something I'd normally do)

In addition:

- redux is used to handle application state
- react-router is used for page routing 
- there is a static version of the api in /api/static
